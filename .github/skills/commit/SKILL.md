# Git Commit

This skill creates a git commit based on current changes.

**For the full workflow, switch to the `@commit` agent.**

## What the Agent Does

The `@commit` agent:

1. Analyzes current git status and diff
2. Stages relevant files
3. Creates a commit with an appropriate message

## Commit Message Style

- Lowercase, descriptive messages without prefixes
- Tightly scoped commits
- Focus on "why" rather than "what"

## Quick Start

Type `@commit` in chat to create a commit from your changes.
