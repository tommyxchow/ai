# Frontend Design

This skill creates distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

**For the full workflow, switch to the `@frontend-design` agent.**

## What the Agent Does

The `@frontend-design` agent:

1. **Design Thinking** - Commits to a bold aesthetic direction
2. **Implementation** - Creates production-grade, functional code
3. **Refinement** - Ensures meticulous attention to detail

## Aesthetic Focus Areas

- **Typography**: Distinctive, characterful font choices
- **Color & Theme**: Cohesive palettes with dominant colors and sharp accents
- **Motion**: High-impact animations and micro-interactions
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts, asymmetry, grid-breaking elements
- **Visual Details**: Textures, gradients, atmospheric effects

## What to Avoid

- Generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- Cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- Predictable, cookie-cutter layouts

## Quick Start
